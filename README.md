# HLX_Faction_Containers V1.1
Helix Faction Containers adds the ability to assign containers to specific factions or classes. Players can temporarily retrieve equipment assigned to their faction from these containers. Faction items are marked with a small blue dot, indicating that they cannot be dropped or storedâ€”they are meant to be used only. For example, a police officer can take their weapon from a faction container and use it, but cannot give it to anyone else.
